Prompt: update the css so that the footer content h2 has the same font style as in rendered/index.html
Response: Matched the footer content heading typography to the rendered design by styling `.site-footer-content h2` with bold 1.875rem/2.25rem sizing and a >=768px bump to 2.25rem/2.5rem (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:394`).
- Tests: not run (CSS-only change).
- Next 1. Clear TYPO3 frontend caches or rebuild assets so the updated stylesheet is served.
Prompt: the burger menu currently does not open on click and show the submenu. fix it by updating fluid template, css, js and typoscript
Response: Added an accessible mobile drawer navigation (TypoScript wiring in `Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript`, styles in `Resources/Public/Css/site.css:340`, behaviour in `Resources/Public/JavaScript/navigation.js`, and wrapped the nav in `Resources/Private/Templates/Page/Index.html`) so the burger toggle opens, closes, and reveals submenus.
- Tests: not run (frontend change only).
- Next 1. Flush TYPO3 caches or reload the frontend to pull in the updated assets.
Prompt: replicate the flyout submenu of the subpages in the main navigation from rendered/index.html in this extension by updating the typoscript, css and js
Response: Built a desktop mega-menu using TYPO3 HMENU (parent entries now load registers for slugged IDs and emit flyout markup, `Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:63`), styled the drawer and sub-links to mirror the rendered design (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:344`), and extended `navigation.js` with desktop hover/focus logic while preserving the mobile drawer (`Resources/Public/JavaScript/navigation.js:1`).
- Tests: not run (interaction change only).
- Next 1. Clear TYPO3 caches and rebuild frontend assets to pick up the new navigation bundle.
Prompt: LOAD_REGISTER and RESTORE_REGISTER that you used for the submenu are deprecated in TYPO3 13. fix it in the typoscript.
Response: Replaced the deprecated register usage with a reusable slug helper (`lib.mainNavigation.slug`) and substituted placeholders via `stdWrap.replacement`, keeping the flyout markup identical while staying TYPO3 13 compliant (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:62`).
- Tests: not run (configuration change only).
- Next 1. Flush the TYPO3 caches so the updated TypoScript is parsed.
Prompt: js console says "tailwind is not defined" in tailwind config. load tailwind js properly.
Response: Guarded the Tailwind config by initialising `window.tailwind` before assigning its `config`, preventing the ReferenceError while keeping the CDN order intact (`Resources/Public/JavaScript/tailwind-config.js:1`).
- Tests: not run (JS safety fix only).
- Next 1. Reload the frontend to confirm the console warning is gone.
Prompt: there is a content area with white background, that starts with the text "trusted across all industries". add the area to the extension in fluid template, typoscript, tsconfig and css
Response: Introduced a dedicated "Trusted Across All Industries" section with Fluid markup (`Resources/Private/Templates/Page/Index.html:24`), styled the block and its grid in `Resources/Public/Css/site.css:348`, exposed a new content column via TypoScript (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:139`) and constants (`Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript:10`), and registered the colPos/labels in page TSconfig and language files for backend editing (`Configuration/page.tsconfig:3`, `Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:6`).
- Tests: not run (content rendering change only).
- Next 1. Flush TYPO3 caches and populate the new column with industry tiles.
Prompt: the trusted industry items in this content area should be a new content element type with an icon, headline and text as in rendered/index.html.
Response: Added a dedicated `trusted_industry_item` CType (TCA + wizard entries in `Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content_trustedIndustryItem.php` and `Configuration/page.tsconfig:39`), rendered via Fluid (`Resources/Private/Templates/Content/TrustedIndustryItem.html`) with TypoScript wiring and asset processing (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:152`). Styling now targets the card/icon structure for consistent white tiles (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:365`), and editors can manage the new items with localized labels/constants (`Configuration/TypoScript/constants.typoscript:12`, `Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:12`).
- Tests: not run (CMS rendering change only).
- Next 1. Add icon media to each trusted industry item so the new cards display as designed.
Prompt: the icon of the new content element for trusted industries is not a file but a font from ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol", "Noto Color Emoji" per CSS. change the element, html and css accordingly as in rendered/index.html
Response: Swapped the trusted industry card icon to use a dedicated emoji/input field (`tx_iesitetemplate_icon`) instead of file assets, updated the CType configuration (`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/tt_content_trustedIndustryItem.php`) and translations, removed the file processor from TypoScript (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:152`), rendered the symbol in Fluid (`Resources/Private/Templates/Content/TrustedIndustryItem.html`), and styled it with the specified font stack (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:398`).
- Tests: not run (rendering/style tweak only).
- Next 1. Enter emoji/symbol characters in the new icon field for each trusted industry item.
Prompt: the new content element is not rendered. why?
Response: Rendering failed because the trusted industry FLUIDTEMPLATE had no partial lookup path, so the SVG partial call returned nothing. Added the shared partial root (`partialRootPaths.10`) to the content element setup so the selected icon partial can be resolved (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:346`).
- Tests: not run (configuration fix only).
- Next 1. Flush TYPO3 caches to reload TypoScript and confirm the cards reappear.
