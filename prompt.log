Prompt: update the css so that the footer content h2 has the same font style as in rendered/index.html
Response: Matched the footer content heading typography to the rendered design by styling `.site-footer-content h2` with bold 1.875rem/2.25rem sizing and a >=768px bump to 2.25rem/2.5rem (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:394`).
- Tests: not run (CSS-only change).
- Next 1. Clear TYPO3 frontend caches or rebuild assets so the updated stylesheet is served.
Prompt: the burger menu currently does not open on click and show the submenu. fix it by updating fluid template, css, js and typoscript
Response: Added an accessible mobile drawer navigation (TypoScript wiring in `Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript`, styles in `Resources/Public/Css/site.css:340`, behaviour in `Resources/Public/JavaScript/navigation.js`, and wrapped the nav in `Resources/Private/Templates/Page/Index.html`) so the burger toggle opens, closes, and reveals submenus.
- Tests: not run (frontend change only).
- Next 1. Flush TYPO3 caches or reload the frontend to pull in the updated assets.
Prompt: replicate the flyout submenu of the subpages in the main navigation from rendered/index.html in this extension by updating the typoscript, css and js
Response: Built a desktop mega-menu using TYPO3 HMENU (parent entries now load registers for slugged IDs and emit flyout markup, `Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:63`), styled the drawer and sub-links to mirror the rendered design (`Resources/Public/Css/site.css:344`), and extended `navigation.js` with desktop hover/focus logic while preserving the mobile drawer (`Resources/Public/JavaScript/navigation.js:1`).
- Tests: not run (interaction change only).
- Next 1. Clear TYPO3 caches and rebuild frontend assets to pick up the new navigation bundle.
Prompt: LOAD_REGISTER and RESTORE_REGISTER that you used for the submenu are deprecated in TYPO3 13. fix it in the typoscript.
Response: Replaced the deprecated register usage with a reusable slug helper (`lib.mainNavigation.slug`) and substituted placeholders via `stdWrap.replacement`, keeping the flyout markup identical while staying TYPO3 13 compliant (`Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript:62`).
- Tests: not run (configuration change only).
- Next 1. Flush the TYPO3 caches so the updated TypoScript is parsed.
